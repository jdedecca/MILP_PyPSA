component,list_name,description
Network,networks,"Container for all components and functions which act upon the whole network."
SubNetwork,sub_networks
Bus,buses,"Electrically fundamental node where x-port objects attach."
Carrier,carriers,"Energy carrier, such as wind, PV or coal. The Carrier tracks co2 emissions if there is a network.co2_limit.  Buses have direct carriers and Generators indicate their primary energy carriers."
Line,lines,"Lines include distribution and transmission lines, overhead lines and cables."
LineType,line_types,"Standard line types with per length values for impedances."
Transformer,transformers,"2-winding transformer."
TransformerType,transformer_types,"Standard 2-winding transformer types."
Link,links,"Link between two buses with controllable active power - can be used for a transport power flow model OR as a simplified version of point-to-point DC connection OR as a lossy energy converter. NB: for a lossless bi-directional HVDC or transport link, set p_min_pu = -1 and efficiency = 1. NB: It is assumed that the links neither produce nor consume reactive power."
Load,loads,"PQ power consumer."
Generator,generators,"Power generator."
StorageUnit,storage_units,"Storage unit with fixed nominal-energy-to-nominal-power ratio."
Store,stores,"Generic store, whose capacity may be optimised."
ShuntImpedance,shunt_impedances,"Shunt y = g + jb."
